Well hello there

🗨️ Currently actively working with these languages:
- Python
- C#
- C

🕒 Languages I've used in the past:
- Javascript
- Java
- C++
- Lua
- GDscript (Language used in godot game engine)

🤔 Some probably interesting about me:
- Absolutely sucks at anything graphical.
- ~Self taught (Which means I'm probably sucks at the very technical level)~ Finally in college!

🏃‍➡️ Current Active project: None

🧠 Fun fact: My codes are as tidy and well-documented as my college notes. That is to say, I don't know where my discreet mathematics notes are, and I don't know how my professor’s talk about morals have anything to do with Program Design Methods.

Well... What eles are you expecting me to say here?

# ðŸ’« About Me:
### ðŸ¤” Some probably interesting about me:
- Absolutely sucks at anything graphical.
- Honestly, I don't know what else.
- As I said I don't know.
- I can be quite indecisive.
- Okay I think that's all.

### ðŸ§  Fun fact:
My codes are as tidy and well-documented as my college notes. That is to say, I don't know where my discreet mathematics notes are, and I don't know how my professorâ€™s talk about moral has anything to do with Program Design Methods.
